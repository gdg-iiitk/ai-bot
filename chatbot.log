2025-01-14 10:54:39,957 - INFO - Context Response: Okay, I can help with that! However, I don't have access to the live, daily menu for the IIIT Kottayam mess. 

Here's how you can usually find out what's for lunch:

**1. Check Official Mess Notices:**

*   **Notice Boards:** Look for the mess menu posted on notice boards within the mess or around the campus.
*   **Mess App/Website:** Check if IIIT Kottayam has a dedicated app or website where they post the daily menu.
*   **Student Groups/Forums:** Join student groups on platforms like WhatsApp or Telegram, where students often share the menu.

**2. Ask Directly:**

*   **Mess Staff:** If you're near the mess, you could ask a staff member.
*   **Friends:** Check with your friends on campus if they know what's being served.

**To help me give you a better answer in the future, could you tell me if:**

*   **You have a particular mess you're referring to (e.g., hostel mess 1, mess 2)?**
*   **You know of any apps or websites that IIIT Kottayam uses to post mess menus?**

I hope this helps you find out what's for lunch today!
